      <p>I am a doctoral student in Political Theory at the University of Oxford, where I study utopia and Yiddish political thought.</p>
      <p>In my doctoral dissertation, <em>Dispatches from Diaspora: Recovering the History of Yiddish Political Thought</em>, I explicate three central ideas in Yiddish political thought — Yiddishism, Autonomism, and Doikayt — and identify the relations between Yiddish political thought and parallel traditions.</p>
      <p>I prioritise archival research and close reading of primary sources in Yiddish, ranging from scholarly treatises and monographs, to popular pamphlets, poetry, and fiction. I also draw from analytical and continental political philosophy, critical theory, sociolinguistics, and intellectual history.</p>
      <p>For my DPhil I have received generous funding from the Department of Politics and International Relations. I obtained my MPhil in Political Theory at the University of Oxford in 2024 with the support of the Truman Foundation. In my MPhil thesis, I developed and used a function-based approach to analysing utopian texts to provide the first extended study of Kalman Zingman’s Yiddish-language utopian novel <em>In Der Tsukunft-Shtot Edenia</em> (1918). Before coming to Oxford, I completed a B.A. at Colorado College, where I focused on jurisprudence and the history of political thought. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on dignity-based arguments for regulating hate speech.</p>
